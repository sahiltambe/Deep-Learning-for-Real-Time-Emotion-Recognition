# Emotion Detection with Transfer Learning

## Overview

This project implements an emotion detection system using transfer learning with pre-trained deep learning models. The system allows users to upload images, and the model predicts the dominant emotion expressed in the image. The implementation includes model training, evaluation, and deployment using Gradio.

## Features

- Utilizes pre-trained deep learning models (VGG16 and ResNet50) for feature extraction.
- Implements data augmentation and class weighting to handle imbalanced datasets.
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Deploys the trained model using Gradio for real-time emotion detection from images.

## Sequence of Implementation

1. **Data Preparation**: Organize the dataset into training and testing directories.

2. **Model Training**:
   - **Custom_CNN_From_Scratch**:
     - Implements a custom CNN architecture from scratch.
     - Defines and trains the model without pre-trained weights.
     - Evaluates the model's performance.

   - **Custom_CNN_With_Augmentation**:
     - Implements a custom CNN architecture with data augmentation.
     - Incorporates data augmentation techniques such as rotation, zoom, and horizontal flip.
     - Trains the model and evaluates its performance.

   - **VGG16 Transfer Learning**:
     - Utilizes the VGG16 architecture with transfer learning.
     - Implements data augmentation and class weighting.
     - Trains the model and evaluates performance.

   - **ResNet50 Transfer Learning**:
     - Utilizes the ResNet50 architecture with transfer learning.
     - Implements data augmentation and class weighting.
     - Trains the model and evaluates performance.

3. **Model Deployment**:
   - Implements a Gradio interface for real-time emotion detection from uploaded images.

## Getting Started
